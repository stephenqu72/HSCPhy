  "Answer": "## Marking Guide:\n\n**(a) Identify the initial direction of the force experienced by the electron and explain your reasoning, referring to the nature of the electric field and the charge. (3 marks)**\n\n**Answer:**\n*   **Direction:** The force experienced by the electron is to the **left** (opposite to the direction of the electric field lines). (1 mark)\n*   **Reasoning:** Electric field lines are conventionally defined as pointing in the direction of the force experienced by a *positive* test charge. (1 mark)\n*   Since an electron carries a *negative* elementary charge, the force it experiences in an electric field will be in the opposite direction to the electric field lines. (1 mark)\n\n**(b) The electron is then released and accelerates. If it moves a distance of 5.0 cm, travelling directly against the direction of the electric field lines, and gains $3.2 \\times 10^{-17}$ J of kinetic energy, calculate the electric potential difference it moved through. (3 marks)**\n\n**Answer:**\n*   The gain in kinetic energy ($\\Delta K$) of the electron is due to the work done by the electric field ($W_E$), so $W_E = \\Delta K = 3.2 \\times 10^{-17}$ J. (1 mark)\n*   The work done by the electric field is related to the charge ($q$) and the potential difference ($\\Delta V = V_f - V_i$) by the formula $W_E = -q \\Delta V$.\n    Substituting the values (electron charge $q = -1.602 \\times 10^{-19}$ C):\n    $3.2 \\times 10^{-17} = -(-1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\Delta V$ (1 mark for correct formula and substitution of $q$)\n*   Solving for $\\Delta V$: \n    $\\Delta V = \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{-17}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19}} \\approx 199.75$ V\n    Rounding to 2 significant figures (consistent with input data): $\\Delta V = 2.0 \\times 10^2$ V (or 200 V). (1 mark for correct calculation and units)\n\n**(c) Using your answer from part (b) and the given distance, calculate the magnitude of the uniform electric field. (2 marks)**\n\n**Answer:**\n*   For a uniform electric field, the magnitude of the electric field ($E$) is related to the potential difference ($\\Delta V$) and the distance ($d$) by the formula $E = \\frac{\\Delta V}{d}$. (1 mark for formula)\n*   Substitute the values:\n    $d = 5.0 \\text{ cm} = 0.050 \\text{ m}$\n    $E = \\frac{199.75 \\text{ V}}{0.050 \\text{ m}} = 3995 \\text{ V/m}$\n    Rounding to 2 significant figures: $E = 4.0 \\times 10^3 \\text{ V/m}$ (or N/C).
